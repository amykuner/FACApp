# Founders and Coders Application Website
This is my application website for Founders and Coders. Founders and Coders is a non-profit organisation that runs peer-led web development courses. It runs the [Tech for Better](https://www.foundersandcoders.com/tech-for-better) programme and prioritises diversity within its community.

The application required our websites to be written entirely in vanilla javascript, CSS and HTML, hosted on GitHub Pages. It also required that we explain why we wnt to be part of the programme, and contain links to our Codewars, GitHub, and freeCodeCamp profiles.
